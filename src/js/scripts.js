 * scripts.js | v1.0.0
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Main JavaScript file for the coastalskin theme.

 * enhancements, and UI behaviours across the theme. Functions are modularised
 * where possible to promote maintainability and resuability.
 *
 * Contents:
 * - DOMContentLoaded initialisation
 * - Component behaviours
 * - Accessibility enhancements (e.g., focus management)
 * - Utility functions for common DOM interactions
 *
 * NOTE: Keep this file limited to theme-wide behaviour. Component-specific
 * scripts should be placed in their respective JS partials or modules to
 * maintain clean speration.
